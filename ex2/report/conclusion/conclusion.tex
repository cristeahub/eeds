\section{Conclusion}

In doing this assignment, we learned how to produce sound through sound wave synthesis, and how in general sound is converted from digital to analog audio.
We also used what we learned during the first assignment, implementing interruptions in C to achieve energy efficiency.
Moreover, we learned about the different sounds one may generate from different types of waveforms, more spesifically the sawtooth waveform, triangle waveform and square waveform.
Furthermore, we learned how to produce whitenoise by outputting random frequencies repeatedly, as whitenoise is a combination of all frequencies.
By making a .wav file and converting it to C arrays, we also achieved a greater understanding in how discrete samples form sounds and music when they are feeded to the DAC continuously, closing the gap between digital and analog technology.

We also managed to implement the sound playing in an energy efficient way. When the sounds are playing, the system uses quite a lot of energy.
At the moment the music stops, the system goes into sleep mode.
This implementation keeps the power consumption at a minimum, only consuming power when necessary.
We have truly gained a greater understanding in how to influence the power consumption, especially in regards to audio.
