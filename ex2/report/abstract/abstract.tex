\section{Abstract}

This report provides a solution to the second lab exercise in TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems.
The goal of this exercise was to learn about energy efficient programming and how to influence the power consumption by using power-saving methodologies.
An EFM32 microcontroller, a microcontroller with focus on low power applications, was attached to a gamepad with eight buttons and eight LED lights. We took advantage of several tools from the GNU toolchain in the development process. By following the steps mentioned in the compendium\cite{eeds-compendium}, we were able to turn on the lights based on button presses in an energy efficient way.
