\section{Abstract}

This report provides a solution to the second lab exercise in TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems.
The goal of this exercise was to produce sound effects, making different sounds play on different button pushes.
A DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) was connected to an amplifier on the DK3750 development board. The DAC generates analog signals based on digital values in the code. Using this hardware and the C programming language, we were able to produce the expected sounds through sound wave synthesis.
