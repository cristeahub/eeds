\section{Abstract}

This report provides a solution to the second lab exercise in TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems.
The goal of this exercise was to produce sound effects by pushing different buttons.
A DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) was connected to an amplifier on the DK3750 development board.
The DAC generates analog signals based on values written to a memory area.
By using the EFM32GG development board and writing code in the C programming language, we were able to produce different sounds through sound wave synthesis.
