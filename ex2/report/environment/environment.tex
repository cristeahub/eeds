\section{Development environment}
We used all of the tools from the previous assignment \cite{report-1}, in addition to some new tools which will be outlined here.

\subsection{C Programming language}
The C programming language was used in this assignment, and the GNU C Compiler GCC was used for compiling.
The gcc command was also used for linking C files, like the EFM32GG startup code and useful libraries. By using pointers that point to the I/O registers, we were able to directly control the EFM32GG board. In opposition to assignment 1, we also had to write the interrupt handling in C in this assignment.
