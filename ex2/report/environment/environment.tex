\section{Development environment}
We used all of the tools from the previous assignment \cite{report-1}, in addition to some new tools which will be outlined here.

\subsection{C Programming language}
The C programming language was used in this assignment, and the GNU C Compiler GCC was used for compiling.
The gcc command was also used for linking C files, like the EFM32GG startup code and useful libraries. By using pointers that point to the I/O registers, we were able to directly control the EFM32GG board. In opposition to assignment 1, we also had to write the interrupt handling in C in this assignment.

\subsection{KOSS UR5}

For listening to the sounds generated by the DAC, we used KOSS UR5 headphones, provided by the lab.
The headphones were connected to the EFM32 microcontroller, and we could through these listen to the analog audio generated by the DAC.
The KOSS UR5 headphones have a frequency range from 80Hz - 18KHz, which is good enough for the purpose of this assignment, even though human hearing range is averaging from 20Hz to 20KHz.
