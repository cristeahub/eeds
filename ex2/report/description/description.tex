\section{Development process and implementation}
\label{chap:development_process}

This chapter details the steps used during the development of the program.
We started by re-implementing most of the code used in the previous exercise, only this time in C.
In addition we set up a timer, which was to be used for interacting with the DAC.

\subsection{Setting up the DAC}

To get sound playing on the board, we had to use the DAC, a Digital-to-Analog Converter.
A timer was needed to be able to continuously write sound samples to the DAC.

\subsection{Timer}

The timer clock frequency is 14MHz, but for the music we only want a freqency of 44100KHz.
Therefore we set the sample period to $ \frac{\SI{14}{\mega\hertz}}{\SI{44100}{\hertz}} \approx 317 $.
This will ensure the timer interrupt is triggered 44100 times a second.

\subsection{Pre-recorded melody}

For the start-up melody, we chose to produce a song using FL Studio, a digital audio workstation.
We would then export the .wav file and convert it to a C array, as a wav file consists of two channels of typically 44,100 samples per second, and 8 bits per sample.
We had to first export the song to a 16-bit int .wav file, as FL Studio didn't accept 8-bit uint .wavformat.
We opened the song in Audacity, as this audio editor allowed us to export it to a 8 bit int .wav file.
Moreover, we used a Python library to convert the .wav samples to a C array, tailoring this general Python .wav interpreter code \cite{wav} to fit our needs. Our edited Python code to produce the C file that holds the two arrays that represents the two channels is shown in figure \ref{fig:python} in appendix A.

The sound clip we made originally lasted around 15 seconds, which results in $\SI{44100}{Hz} * 15 \text{seconds} = 661500 \text{samples}$.
Since this file was too large for the DAC, we shortened the song to 8 seconds.
This wav-file amounted to 704 kB of space, which became 3.5 MB when converted to two arrays in C. This proved to be small enough for the DAC to interpret.

The start up melody can be found here. \cite{song}

\subsection{Button control}

Buttons are set up to control one sound effect each. The remaining buttons will stop the sound currently playing.
