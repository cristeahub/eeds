\section{Development process and implementation}
\label{chap:development_process}

This chapter details the steps used during the development of the program.
We started by re-implementing most of the code used in the previous exercise, only this time in C.
In addition we set up a timer, which was to be used for interacting with the DAC.

% - setting up interrupts from c
% - embedding assembly

\subsection{Setting up the DAC}

To get sound playing on the board, we had to use the DAC, a Digital-to-Analog Converter.
A timer was needed to be able to continuously write sound samples to the DAC.

\subsection{Pre-recorded melody}

% Details of exporting from FL Studio, convert to C array

\subsection{Button control}

Buttons are set up to control one sound effect each. The remaining buttons will stop the sound currently playing.
