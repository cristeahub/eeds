\section{Introduction}

In this exercise, a C program that plays sound effects as a response to button pushes on the gamepad was written.

The user is able to play the desired sound effect through pushing different button on the gamepad.
Achieving energy efficience through an intelligent use of interrupt handling was one of the main issues in this exercise, and an explanation of our procedure to solve this problem will follow in this report.
Moreover, we will in this report describe how we through sound wave synthesis managed to produce the different sounds.
The explanation of our setup and our code will result in our test results and and evaluation of the assignment.
