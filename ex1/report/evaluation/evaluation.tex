\section{Evaluation of Assignment}

The assignment turned out to be very instructive yet challenging. The compendium \cite{eeds-compendium} introduced the exercise in an informative way, giving useful step-by-step instructions for how to approach the problem, as well as giving eludicative information about the components that we were required to use in this exercise.

Using the EFM32 microcontroller was a great way to learn about energy efficiency and how to apply this information in practical situations. The indoor climate at the lab, though, felt pretty bad when the lab got cramped. Sitting hour after hour in a small, cramped room, was exhausting at times. However, the exercise provided a great introduction to energy efficient computer systems.
