Copy the shit out of the ones already here and use \cite{...} where ... is the first parameter (i.e. eeds-compendium).

@misc{eeds-compendium,
        title           =   "Lab Exercises in TDT4258 Energy Exercisescient Computer Systems",
        author          =   "Computer Architecture and Design Group",
        institution     =   "Department of Computer and Information Science, NTNU",
        howpublished    =   {It's learning},
}
