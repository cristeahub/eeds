\section{Introduction}

In this exercise, an assembly program that lets the user control LED lights by pushing buttons on a gamepad was written. By default, none of the LED lights are lighted. The user is then able to lighten the lights numbered one through eight by pushing the corresponding button on the gamepad. The main issue of this exercise was to make the program as energy efficient as possible, and this report will in detail describe how we solved this problem through power saving methodologies. A thorough description of our work, test results and an evaluation of the assignment will follow, all culminating in a mind-boggling conclusion.
