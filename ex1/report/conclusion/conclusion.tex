\section{Conclusion}

The LED lights on the gamepad lights up as intended when the corresponding buttons are pushed. We also managed to implement it in a energy efficient way. We have, by completing this assignment, gained a greater understanding of not only how to influence the energy efficience, but also in assembly programming, the EFM32 microcontroller, and the GNU toolchain in general. Furthermore, it became clear from the tests that using interrupts was a huge improvement, in regards to power-consumption, over polling. This was also the expected result according to [FORSLAG].
