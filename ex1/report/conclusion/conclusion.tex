\section{Conclusion}

The LED lights on the gamepad lights up as intended when the corresponding buttons are pushed. We also managed to implement it in an energy efficient way, as required by the assignment. We have, by completing this assignment, gained a greater understanding of not only how to influence the energy efficience, but also of assembly programming, the EFM32 microcontroller, and the GNU toolchain in general. Furthermore, it became clear from the test results that using interrupts and letting the CPU sleep when there was no I/O to be processed was a improvement, in regards to power-consumption, over polling. Especially the deep sleep mode (energy mode 2) was extremely efficient over both regular sleep mode (energy mode 1) and polling. This was also the expected result according to the theory.
