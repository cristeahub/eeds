\section{Results and Tests}

As mentioned in the description section, we implemented two versions of this program; the first one using polling, where the computer has to check the status of the GPIO repeatedly, and the final version using interrupts, where the program may sleep between its tasks. The version running interrupts is, of course, expected to produce significantly less power consumptive results. Below follows test results for both programs, with a summarizing comparison at the end.
