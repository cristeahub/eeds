This report provides a solution to the first lab exercise in TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems. The goal of this exercise was to learn about energy efficient programming and how to influence the power consumption by using power-saving methodologies. An EFM32 microcontroller, a microcontroller with focus on low power applications, was attached to the GPIO (General Purpose I/O) controller. By reading the buttons on the GPIO, we were able to light up its LED lights. Moreover, by measuring the power consumption in real-time, we were, by the use of interrupts, able to keep it to a minimum.
