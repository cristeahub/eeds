config PLATFORM
	prompt "platform name"
	string

	  This string identifies the platform. You should give a concise name

	  you want a ptxdist-1 behaviour (less or more flat directories), keep
	  this entry empty.

config PLATFORM_VERSION
	prompt "platform version"
	string
	default "-trunk"
	help
	  This is the revision of the platform.
	  The string is supposed to start with an "-".
