Subject: [PATCH] ARM: drop !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM dependency of XIP_KERNEL
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Enabling XIP_KERNEL requires specifying the physical address of the readonly
memory. As these addresses vary among different SoCs and even machines with
the same SoC enabling XIP_KERNEL might restrict the set of machines that can
run the resulting kernel to a subset of the configured in machines.

Still allowing XIP_KERNEL for a MULTIPLATFORM kernel makes sense as for some
platforms MULTIPLATFORM is mandatory (e.g. bcm, highbank or imx). So to
allow compiling a XIP kernel for these platforms, allow selecting XIP in the
presence of ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.

This patch might be problematic for compile coverage testing according to
Arnd. Still I need XIP for my efm32 machine as it only features 4 MiB of
RAM.

 	  Execute-In-Place allows the kernel to run from non-volatile storage
 	  directly addressable by the CPU, such as NOR flash. This saves RAM
