\section{Introduction}

In this exercise, we made a computer game playable on the EFM32 microcontroller.

We made a puzzle game inspired by Tetris and Bejewelled with simplified rules. We will in this report explain in detail how we wrote the driver for the gamepad, how we made the game, and give an explanation on how we ensured that our implementation ran as energy efficiently as possible. We will then give an evaluation of the assignment and a conclusion that includes statistics about the energy consumption.
