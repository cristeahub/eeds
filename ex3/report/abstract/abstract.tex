\section{Abstract}

This report provides a solution to the third lab exercise in TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems, in which we were supposed to make a computer game.

We chose to implement a puzzle game with similarities to Tetris and Bejewelled.
A variation of these classic computer games should be simple enough to implement with the limited resources we've got. The goal of this assignment was to make a functioning implementation of a computer game on the EFM32 microcontroller, by building the \si{\micro} Clinux for the board, making a driver for the gamepad, and writing the computer game in the C programming language.
