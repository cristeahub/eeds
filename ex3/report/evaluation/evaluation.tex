\section{Evaluation of Assignment}

This assignment was a great introduction to I/O programming in C. In addition to improving our C programming skills, we also learned a lot about sound generation and how the digital/analog conversion is done. The compendium \cite{eeds-compendium} introduced the exercise in an informative way, giving useful step-by-step instructions for how to approach the problem. It also contained useful information about the gcc, hardware access from C code and interrupt handling in C, which we used for solving the problem.

This assignment was a great continuation to the previous assignment, and the C programming felt like a natural way to proceed from the assembly code in the previous assignment.
